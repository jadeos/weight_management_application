This was my final year project for my 4th and final year at CIT. My main objective was to design and develop a user friendly weight management application that uses a combination of various web technologies to help increase motivation in weight management.

Along with PHP and Javascript, I used Service Workers to provide added functionalities such as working in offline mode and sending push notifications to the users device. The application does work while offline however, it doesnt post data to the database just yet.This is something Id like to work on one day. I also used CanvasJS to graph basic user information such as the amount of weight that has been lost/gained over a time frame. I also attempted to integrate Fitbit to the application, however I only managed to get data reading from the API rather than posting to it. This is also something I will like to achive one day. 

Currently the application does the following:
1. Allows the user to log in or create an account
2. Allows the user to view, update, and and delete any of their information such as the amount of weight lost/gained, food eaten, exercise, steps and water intake. 
3. Allows the user to view their nutrition, steps and weight infomormation in graphical form.
4. Allows the user to set and recieve notifications from the application. 
5. Allows the user to set basic account information such as their password and email.
6. Allows the user to update any of their data such as their weight, height etc.
7. Allows the user to delete their account.
8. Allows an admin user to view users registered on the application and update and delete their information. 
9. Allows the admin user to track user activity on the application using the google anylitics API.

The application can be seen at: https://www.weightmentor.eu/views/home.php
